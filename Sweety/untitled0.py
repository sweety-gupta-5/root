5. Literature Survey
[1] In this paper ,we studied a relational database comparison tool  viz. DBCompare which is written in Base SAS® for the comparison of data definitions of SAS® datasets across databases and provides report as html /pdf file.This paper gives a insight on different ways to address the task of comparing the data definitions/schema of table.
[2] PROC COMPARE is a SAS® procedure which provides the programmer with a simple facility for comparing two datasets.This paper surveys some common pitfalls in the use of PROC COMPARE and explains how to avoid them.It mentions some of the blind spots like missing variables,conflicting types,etc,which we have taken into consideration while developing SQLator.
